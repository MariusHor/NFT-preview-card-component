## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project I learned to do an overlay effect on an image and this was something that I was wondering how can be done. Although it wasnt easy to 
find a solution, I am glad that I finally did so I will make sure it sticks 
with me.

### Continued development

I continued to practice my skills with card creation and I am glad I did because it is something that I plan to fully understand for my future projects.
